Hi! My name is Emilie, I just finished my PhD in electronics and material science. I'm super excited to start working in science education. Wish me luck!

Here's a bit more about me: I was born in the United States of America, but grew up in Belgium. I recently finished my PhD about using new materials called [Polyoxometalates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyoxometalate) to make better electronic memories (information storage). If you'd like to learn more about my research, check out my [PhD research blog post](/blog/2024/phd/).

Before that, I studied chemistry at the Université Libre de Bruxelles (Belgium), and then got a combined international master's degree (Advanced Spectroscopy in Chemistry) from the Université de Lille (France), Universität Leipzig (Germany), and Uniwersytet Jagielloński w Krakowie (Poland).

Besides science, I also really enjoy travelling and meeting people. To combine all my passions, my goal is to become an outreach scientist. In this blog, I'd like to showcase my existing scientific, communication, and organizational expertise along with the new skills I will acquire along the way. For example, in the [teaching section](/teaching), you can find some workshop materials I created in the past. If you're interested in reading more about my work, please look through my [blog posts](/blog/), and check out my [CV](/cv/). If you have any questions, feel free to email me (see below)!
